Application for MERN Developer

Dear Vijayalaxmi,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m reaching out to express my interest in the MERN Developer role at CloudTara Technologies. Instead of just submitting my CV, I wanted to provide a more comprehensive view of my work by sharing my portfolio and GitHub repository. I believe this will effectively showcase my expertise and passion for full-stack development.

As a Fullstack Engineer, I have experience building dynamic and scalable applications. One of my key projects, Dev Social, is a Developer Networking Platform built with React, Redux, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.io. This project integrates user authentication, real-time chat, and a seamless UI, demonstrating my ability to create both engaging frontend experiences and efficient backend systems.

Looking forward to your response.
